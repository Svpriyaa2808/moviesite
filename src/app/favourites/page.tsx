                <p className="mb-4">Movies have been enchanting audiences for over a century, and behind every blockbuster lies a world of fascinating trivia. For instance, The Lord of the Rings trilogy, filmed in New Zealand, used over 48,000 props, from swords to hobbit-sized furniture. Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho was the first American film to show a flushing toilet on screen—a surprisingly controversial moment in 1960!</p>
                <p className="mb-4">The famous “I’m the king of the world!” line in Titanic wasn’t in the original script—Leonardo DiCaprio improvised it, and it became one of cinema’s most iconic quotes. Meanwhile, Jurassic Park (1993) used groundbreaking CGI that still holds up today, even though it contains only 15 minutes of dinosaur footage.</p>
                <p className="mb-4">In The Dark Knight, Heath Ledger designed the Joker’s makeup himself, giving it a messy, chaotic look that perfectly matched his unhinged character. And in A Quiet Place, the cast learned sign language to make the family’s communication authentic.</p>
                <p>Fun fact: the world’s longest film is “Logistics,” running a mind-boggling 857 hours that’s over a month of continuous viewing!</p>
